# Fashion Classifier - Server

Server runs via [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask).

## Prerequisites

**Make sure that [Python version 3.6.8 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) is installed on your machine as well as all dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)**.

You can quickly satisfy the latter requirement by opening a command line in *WebServer/* and then issuing:

`py -3.6-64 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Launching the Server

Run the server from the *WebServer/* directory via the following command:

 `py -3.6-64 run_server.py`
